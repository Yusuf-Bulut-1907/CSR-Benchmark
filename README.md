# CSR Benchmark Analysis

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to analyze and compare the CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) discourses of major corporations, utilizing their institutional web pages.

Acting as consultants, our mission is to collect, analyze, and compare the CSR commitments published on the websites of large companies from various sectors. This strategic benchmark aims to identify **dominant trends and themes**, extract key **insights**, and analyze the relationships between the data in order to provide informed strategic recommendations.

## Project Plan

This project is divided into several technical and analytical objectives:

### 1. Data Collection (Scraping)

* Implement **web scraping** techniques to extract the textual content from the pages dedicated to Sustainable Development or Social Responsibility across multiple corporate websites.

### 2. Textual Analysis (Text Mining)

* Utilize **Text Mining (NLP)** methods to analyze the collected data, including:
    * Identification of **key themes and promises**.
    * Extraction of **dominant keywords and concepts**.
    * Comparison of the **lexicons** used by the companies.

### 3. Network Analysis (Web Mining)

* Create complex visualizations to represent the relationships between the concepts:
    * Construction of a **concept graph** shared among the companies.
    * Visualization of a **semantic network** of sub-themes addressed in the CSR discourses.
